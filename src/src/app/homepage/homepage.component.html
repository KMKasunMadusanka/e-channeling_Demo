          <h1>Introduction to e-channeling</h1>
          <div>
            <p>
              e-Channelling PLC is the pioneer software development and ICT service provider to the Healthcare industry in Sri Lanka. It
              is the first company in Sri Lanka to offer a complete e-commerce based service and the first public quoted
              Technology Company in the Colombo Stock Exchange. e-Channelling has consistently been part of the 100 top brands
              in Sri Lanka.
            </p>
            <p>
              e-Channelling PLC was established in 2001 by Millennium IT (group company of the London Stock Exchange), another pioneer
              ICT company in Sri Lanka, known worldwide for advanced investment trading systems. In 2001, when the World
              Wide Web was gaining momentum, e-Channelling envisioned an enabling service to eliminate the hassle and the
              inconvenience faced by the general public to obtain an appointment to meet a Specialist or Consultant at the
              time and place convenient to them. At the time when e-Channelling was launched, other nations in the region
              and even UK and USA, did not have service to tie up Doctors, Patients and Hospitals, leveraging the power of
              the Internet and ecommerce.
